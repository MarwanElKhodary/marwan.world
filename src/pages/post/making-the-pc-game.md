## Inspiration

When I started planning making my website, I made a list of inspirational websites that would guide my design process. I knew that ultimately, this website would serve as an excuse for me to write and post more on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marwan-elkhodary/), but I wanted to add an element to it that would distinguish it from other blogs and websites.

I went through [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) daily and started noting websites that had cool elements. My list ranged from beautiful and overly ambitious websites such as [Alistar Shepard's](https://alistairshepherd.uk/), [Jacob Leech's](https://jacobleech.com/) or [Cassie Evans'](https://www.cassie.codes/) to simple, but eye-catching websites with a cool element like [Monica Dinculescu's](https://meowni.ca/), [Chris Kirk-Nielsen's](https://chriskirknielsen.com/) or [Wells Riley's](https://wells.ee/).

While I pride myself as a full-stack developer, I knew I didn't have the chops to call myself a front-end developer... I still have tons to learn about crafting and designing beautiful, engaging websites. So I ended up focusing on trying to add 1 element to my website that would make it stand out.
